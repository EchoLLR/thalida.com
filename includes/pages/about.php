        <p class="normal">
            I am a self-proclaimed web designer/developer/experiencer, but in addition to that I am also a huge robotics enthusiast and I hope to continue working with and growing these various facets of who I am in the future.
        </p>
        <p class="normal">
            I was born in Brooklyn, New York. But, I grew up in Trinidad and Canada. I hope to continue to travel and visit some of the wonderful places around the world.

            I fell in love with robotics early in my High School career.  I joined my high school's robotics team (RoboDoves) and was the only programmer for our team at the time.

            I began experimenting with HTML and CSS when I was 15.  I got my own domain (this one) when I was 16 as a birthday gift (thanks mom!). This site has evolved over the years as I've gotten better and enhanced my skills.
