        "I’m a Frontend Engineer based in New York. I collect identities like candy, I’m a queer Trinidadian  cisgender  woman of color. I’ve been active in the engineering world for 6 odd years. I work with a great group of engineers at Kinnek (we’re hiring!) during the day, and in the wee hours of the night I hack away at one of my many side projects.",
        "I was lucky enough to have a supportive mother, who got me thalida.com for my 16<sup>th</sup> birthday. It was one of the best gifts I’ve ever received, and is the reason I've become the developer I am today.",
        "I’m generally full of questions, and bubble tea."
