        "I’m a Frontend Engineer based in New York. I collect identities like candy, I’m a queer Trinidadian  cisgender  woman of color. I’ve been active in the engineering world for 6 odd years. I work with a great group of engineers at Kinnek (we’re hiring!) during the day, and in the wee hours of the night I hack away at one of my many side projects.",
